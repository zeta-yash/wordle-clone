A basic **Wordle clone** I built as part of my weekly project.

The goal was to make a **simple but efficient version** of the classic WORDLE game using plain web tech.

## 🕹️ About the Game

- Enter a **5-letter word**  
- 🟩 **Green** → letter is in the right spot  
- 🟨 **Yellow** → letter exists but in the wrong spot  
- ⬜ **Grey** → letter isn’t in the word  
- You only get **6 tries**, so choose wisely 👀

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- JSON  

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation (a lot of it)  
- Event handling  
- Structuring and managing a project  
- Working with JSON  
- Handling basic backend logic  

---

## ⏱️ Time & Updates

- Initial version took about **5.5 hours** to build from scratch  
- Spent **another 10 days** later tweaking the frontend and adding extra features (plus their backend logic)  
- **Hint section was the real culprit** 💀 — totally caught me for **3–4 days**, but now it’s finally working!
